                    <p>"I recently switched my online meal ordering platform from a big company that was taking 13% of every order to your free online ordering platform. I am VERY PLEASED with your service â€”the ease of setup, functionality, multiple delivery zone, visually appealing layout and format all for a GENUINELY FREE COST.Your customer service has been stellar via chat/email despite no phone option. I was initially concerned your international location could be an issue but you have delivered excellent, prompt and understandable customer service via chat every time."</p>
